# Welcome to Matchbox

Matchbox is a matching protocol that connects veBTC holders with veMEZO holders on the Mezo Network. It creates a marketplace where both sides can maximize their earning potential through strategic voting and incentives.

## What is Matchbox?

Matchbox solves a key challenge in the Mezo Earn ecosystem: **how do veBTC holders attract voting power to boost their positions, and how do veMEZO holders find the best opportunities to earn rewards?**

Think of it as a two-sided marketplace:

- **veBTC holders** want their gauges to receive more votes, which increases their boost multiplier and earning potential
- **veMEZO holders** want to earn rewards (bribes) by using their voting power strategically

Matchbox brings these two groups together.

## Who is Matchbox For?

### veMEZO Holders

If you hold veMEZO (locked MEZO tokens), you can:

- Browse all available gauges and their offered incentives
- Vote on gauges to earn bribes proportional to your voting power
- Monitor your APY and optimize your voting strategy
- Claim earned rewards directly through the dashboard

**Get started:** [Voting Guide](/guides/voting)

### veBTC Holders

If you hold veBTC (locked BTC), you can:

- Create and customize your gauge profile to attract voters
- Add incentives (bribes) to encourage veMEZO holders to vote for your gauge
- Monitor your gauge's performance and boost multiplier
- Attract strategic votes to maximize your Mezo Earn rewards

## How It Works

1. **veBTC holders** lock BTC on Mezo Earn and receive a veBTC NFT, which is associated with a gauge
2. **veMEZO holders** lock MEZO on Mezo Earn and receive a veMEZO NFT with voting power
3. On Matchbox, **veBTC holders** can add incentives to their gauge to attract votes
4. **veMEZO holders** browse gauges, evaluate incentives, and vote with their veMEZO
5. Votes boost the veBTC position, and voters earn their share of incentives
